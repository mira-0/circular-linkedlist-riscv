# Circular Linked List in RISC-V Assembly

This repository contains a simple implementation of a circular linked list data structure in RISC-V assembly language, specifically designed to handle chars.

## Overview
The implementation showcases the creation, manipulation, and traversal of a circular linked list using RISC-V assembly language. It demonstrates the basic operations of inserting elements, deleting elements, and traversing the list to perform various functions.

## Operations
- ADD(): Add a char at the end of the list;
- DEL(): Remove specific chars from the list;
- PRINT: Print the elements of the list;
- SORT (Quicksort): Arrange the elements of the list in the following order: punctuation < numbers < lowercase letters < uppercase letters;
- SDX: Shift the elements of the list to the right;
- SSX: Shift the elements of the list to the left;
- REV: Reverse the order of elements in the list.
